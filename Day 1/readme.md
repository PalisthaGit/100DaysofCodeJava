Day 1: Hello World
1. Write a program that prints "Hello World!" to the console
2. Add single line and multi-line comments to your code

Reading List:
1. Learn the difference between Java and Python

Java is a compiled language: the entire code is first compiled into bytecode using javac, then executed by the JVM.

Python is an interpreted language: code is executed line by line by the Python interpreter at runtime.

Java is used where performance, stability, and accuracy are critical â€” like in finance and enterprise systems.

Python is preferred in startups and data science for its simplicity, flexibility, and powerful libraries.

2. What is a Java compiler and how does it work?

A java compiler (usually javac) converts the java source code to bytecode. The bytecode is platform independent and runs on Java Virtual Machine


3. Difference between Compiler and Interpreter
A compiler translates the entire source code into machine code or bytecode before execution. Example: Java (javac).

An interpreter translates and executes the code line by line at runtime. Example: Python.

Key Differences:
Feature	Compiler	Interpreter
Execution	Whole program at once	One line at a time
Speed	Faster after compilation	Slower, because it's real-time
Error Handling	All errors shown after compile	Stops at first error
Example	Java, C	Python, JavaScript
