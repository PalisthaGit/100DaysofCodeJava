Spend this day learning the basic concepts of OOP

Learn about the four main principles of OOP (Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism, Abstraction) and come up with examples of each

Encapsulation is the process of bundling the necessary data and the methods that work on that data into a single unit (a class). It’s important because:
It protects data from unintentional modification.
It prevents direct access to fields from outside the class.
It helps in keeping your code clean and secure.

Inheritance is a process where a child class can inherit the properties and behaviors from another class (called the parent or superclass).

Think of it like this: a Dog is a kind of Animal. So Dog can inherit everything that an Animal has.
It helps to reuse code.
It makes the structure cleaner by using a logical hierarchy (e.g., Animal → Dog, Cow).
It is easy to maintain, since shared behavior is defined in one place.

Polymorphism comes from Greek:
poly means "many"

morph means "form"

So, polymorphism means "many forms."
In Java, polymorphism refers to the ability of the same method to behave differently depending on the context.
There are two types of polymorphism:
Method Overloading – This means using the same method name with different parameters (within the same class).

Method Overriding – This occurs when a child class changes the behavior of a method inherited from the parent class.

Abstraction means hiding the internal details from the user and only showing the essential features.

Think of it like driving a car: you use the wheel, pedals, and gear – but you don’t need to know how the engine works internally.
The user only sees what they need.
It hides the internal logic.
It prevents direct access to sensitive operations.

Access modifiers: public, private and protected
Modifier Where can it be accessed? Example Use
private Only in the same class Sensitive data (e.g. passwords)
default Same package Internal app code
protected Same package + child classes Inheritance use
public Everywhere API methods, utilities

Difference between method overloading and method overriding
