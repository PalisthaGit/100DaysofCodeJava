Day 2: Variables and Data Types
1. Declare and initialize variables for various data types including integer (int), floating-point number (double), and string (String). Then, print each variable to the console.



Reading List:
1. Learn the terms: initialization, declaration and assignment of variables
Declaration: Telling the compiler a variable exists and its type.
Example: int intNumber;

Assignment: Giving a variable a value after declaration.
Example: intNumber = 90;

Initialization: Declaring and assigning a value in one step.
Example: int intNumber = 90;

2. Learn the difference between Primitive and Non-Primitive data types
Primitive data types: Built-in, simple types. Stored directly in memory.
Examples: int, float, char, boolean
Fixed size, no methods attached.

Non-Primitive data types: More complex; created from classes.
Examples: String, Array, Object, Scanner
Can be null, have methods, and dynamic size.

3. Default values and sizes of primitive data types
Type	Size (bits)	Default Value
byte	8	0
short	16	0
int	    32	0
long	64	0L
float	32	0.0f
double	64	0.0d
char	16	'\u0000'
boolean	1  (logical)	false
